    Hi! I'm Joska.
    <p> 
        In September I started my masters Strategic Product Design. Ever since I was young I've been interested in creating new works of art or products. And I still enjoy doing 
        odd jobs in my spare time! So i really like to tackle! For a long time I thought I would go in the direction of IPD, but I am very curious about how I, as an designer, can apply
        my insights in the business field. I am a real streamer and therefore I would like to learn more about market needs, the competitive environment, company resources and the brand image. 
        With my social skills I like to work together in a team and often take the leading role. I think this is a good quality I can use while working for a real client. 
        By choosing y electies correctly and getting a nice internship I hope to answer all my questinos. Do I find the medical field as intresting as when I did the biomedical engineering
        minor? Do I like working for a (bigger) consultancy agency or do I prefer working at a company where I can join the design process from the begin till the end? I'm super excited to find the answers!
